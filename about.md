Astronomers in Tucson are currently involved in a wide range of astronomical survey projects. Upcoming surveys, such as [DESI](http://desi.lbl.gov/) and [LSST](http://lsst.org/), promise to bring transformational scientific opportunities for new discoveries in astronomy. At the same time, we are also facing new challenges on how to utilize big data coming from these survey at unprecedented scales, requiring a close collaboration between astronomers, physicists, mathematicians, and computer scientists. This lunch group aims at bringing scientists interested in astronomical surveys across campus, at LSST, NOAO, and in other astronomical institutions in Tucson, to have open and interactive discussions on topics related to:

- progress and new results from on-going survey projects;
- precursor science of future survey projects such as [DESI](http://desi.lbl.gov/) and [LSST](http://lsst.org/);
- new tools and best practices in data processing, data mining, data visualization and astrostatistics;
- new infrastructure for data archiving, analysis and dissemination.

 We plan to meet every other Tuesday in Steward Observatory Room N305. The meeting format is designed to be interactive,  with short talks and plenty of time for discussions. Our first meeting was on Tuesday Oct 20.
