Building tools for crowded field photometry and time domain analysis 
for the LSST era: Experience and lessons learned using DECAM towards
the Galactic center


Abi talked about his work on stellar photometry in extremely crowded DECam fields near the Galactic center, with an emphasis on practical methodology.
He showed how variable star searches have been done, and how the identification of RR Lyraes is allowing us to determine: 
a) reddening along hundreds of lines of sight, with ability to examine the reddening law;  
construct reddening corrected color-magnitude diagrams for fields near the Galactic center, 
and b) examine the spatial structures traced by the oldest stars and re-determine the distance to the Galactic center.   
This is a work in progress, and the emphasis is on methods and techniques that are relevant for LSST surveys.
