BASS: The Beijing-Arizona Sky Survey

Following on Arjun's talk from two weeks ago, I will describe one more of the DESI imaging surveys. BASS is a 5000 deg2 survey in two optical bands (g and r) covering the North Galactic Cap (dec > 30) using 90Prime on the Steward 90" telescope. The survey is collaboration between the National Observatory of China (NAOC), Steward, and the DESI project. Raw data are immediately available through the NOAO archive and processed images and catalogs will be released on a regular schedule. I will describe the current progress of the survey and some of the lessons learned so far.
