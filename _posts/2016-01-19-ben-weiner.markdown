Development of the Arizona Robotic Telescope Network

Large surveys and time domain astronomy are creating a landscape in which the ability to do flexible scheduling and followup observations will be critical for extracting scientific results. The Arizona Robotic Telescope Network is a concept for a flexible program of PI observing, surveys, synoptic and time domain astrophysics including monitoring, rapid response, followup and characterization of transients and targets of opportunity. Steward Observatory operates and shares in several 1-3m telescopes.  Our goal is to adapt these facilities for queue and interrupt capability.  In the LSST era, we envision a coordinated system across multiple telescopes, where alerts can trigger followup, automated characterization, and imaging and spectroscopic triggers. I will discuss a few science cases for the ARTN and solicit input to define the science drivers and technical requirements - your input is needed and welcome!
