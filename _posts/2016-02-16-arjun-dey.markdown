The Legacy Survey: Imaging the Extragalactic Sky with DECam and Mosaic3

The Dark Energy Camera and Mosaic3 z-band Legacy Surveys are jointly covering 14,000 sq deg of extragalactic sky in preparation for the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument surveys. I will briefly describe the strategies being developed to deal with the observing, reduction and analyses of the data. Since it will be a miracle if I have a real talk by tomorrow, this may be an informal discussion where kibbutzing is welcome.
